# CaeasrCipher
The Caesar Cipher is one of the simplest encryption techniques, where each letter in a text is shifted by a fixed number of places in the alphabet. Despite its simplicity, it introduces fundamental concepts of cryptography, encoding, and security. This project focuses on implementing and understanding the Caesar Cipher, exploring its applications, strengths, and limitations in modern security systems.
# Project Highlights
- Implementation: Develop a functional encoder and decoder for Caesar Cipher.
- Encryption Process: Shift letters forward or backward based on a secret key.
- Decryption: Reverse the shift to retrieve original text using key knowledge.
- User Interface: A simple GUI or command-line interface for ease of interaction.
- Security Analysis: Discuss vulnerabilities and compare with modern encryption techniques.
# Project Aims
- To understand fundamental encryption methods.
- To demonstrate basic cryptographic principles in practical applications.
- To analyze the effectiveness and weaknesses of classical encryption techniques.
- To develop programming skills in implementing encryption algorithms.
